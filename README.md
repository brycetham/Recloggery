# Recloggery v1.0
A recommendations chart powered by [Backloggery](http://backloggery.com)!

### What is Recloggery?
Recloggery uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [DataTables](https://datatables.net) to organize your recommendations on Backloggery into a beautiful table!

### Cool, what does it look like?
You can see my own personal Recloggery [here](https://rawgit.com/brycetham/Recloggery/master/index.html)!

### Where are the files?
It's just this one: [index.html](https://github.com/brycetham/Recloggery/blob/master/index.html)! All of the CSS and JavaScript are included.

### I want a Recloggery!
Sure thing! Just go into the HTML file and where it says  `<span id="username">Battlestriker123</span>` (line 16) replace my username with whatever username you want. Then simply save and copy the file to your website.

### My games aren't appearing!
Recloggery automatically filters for games that have a review score. If you did not assign a review score to a game, it will not appear.
